# overfitme: A package of bad news for high dimension data

Actually, the only thing that works in this package is a demo
of overfitting using linear discriminate analysis. If you run
the function overfitLDA() then a shiny app should appear. You can
change the number of noise features that are used in the lda and note
the effect on train and test confusion matrix, see the train and test
predictions and see the LDA coefficients.
